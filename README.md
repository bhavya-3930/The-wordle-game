How to play the Wordle Game?

Guess the Wordle after 6 attempts, with each effort consisting of 5 letters. If you type a word and immediately see a letter become green, you have entered the proper word. It is possible that a letter will become yellow if it appears in the word to be guessed, but it will be in the incorrect location. Furthermore, if the letters are gray, it means that they were wrong guesses and should not be used again in the next word.

 Each time you make a guess, the color of the crosswords will gradually change to indicate how close you are to getting the correct answer. Alternatively, you might simply try your luck and guess the proper word of the day in two or three turns, or even on the first turn.
